EKS-Playground

What am I trying to do here?

Deploy a website, using my own domain as the public dns.  I want to deploy the website onto an AWS hosted EKS 
Cluster and balance the traffic using kong so I can switch traffic between the pods by modifying the configmap. 



- how do I set up the DNS? 

- Buy a domain

- try and create some modules to make this kinda thing easier in the future...
    - VPC
